# ONT In Vitro Experiments

Oxford Nanopore in vitro sequencing data from human and chimpanzee iPSCs and organoids.  
Focuses on methylation analyses of PTERV and LINC00662.

## Contents

### **Code**
- Basecalling and mapping workflows (human or chimp genomes)
- Script to generate **methylartist composite plots** for PTERV (PT1 + PT2)
- Script to generate **methylartist violin plots** for global PTERV 5mC fraction in iPSCs and organoids
- Script to generate **methylartist locus plots** for LINC00662 (human and chimp)

---

## Outputs
- Figures generated for methylation comparison  
- Mapped reads and methylation calls (not included in repo, data will be deposited to ENA)  

---

## Notes
Reference genome versions and methylartist parameters are documented within each script.
